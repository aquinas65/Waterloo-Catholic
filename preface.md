# Preface

By DEAN HARRIS

"The History of the Catholic Church in the County of Waterloo" is not only the work of a historical student who has industriously burrowed and tunneled into the annals of early times but it is also the compilation of a cholar to the manner born who has in the very texture of his mind the flavour of rural life. When gathering the material for this very informational volume, the author studied the topography of his county; consulted the aged sons and daughters of pioneer settlers; rummaged through files of old newspapers; inspected valuable documents in Registry offices; wrote sheafs of letters in quest of knowledge or to verify his dates ; consulted authorities in parliamentary and provincial libraries, and examined the marriage, death and baptismal registers of central Ontario. His researches have imparted to his History an exceptional life and vitality and a particularity of facts, persons and incidents which constitutes it a depository of valuable information.

The average historian too often contents himself with information gathered from books, and is satisfied to do his work in his own study, but the specialist must seek material for his history from every available source, and with extraordinary industry, care and solicitude. The accumulation of facts for his work is a concern of much trouble and difficulty, and these facts may only be obtained by one who is dowered with special talents and lives close to the people.

Father Spetz fortunately is gifted with an historical intuition and a mastership of detail which impart to his History most valuable qualities.

His book is a work of deep research, full and informational on the struggles, trials and heroism of the pioneer priests and settlers of Waterloo County. It will be read with intense satisfaction by the descendants of the stalwart immigrants who, a hundred years ago, crossed the Atlantic, and with strong bodies and brave hearts entered the wilderness and subdued it. But it is to be hoped the volume will also be read and appreciated by many outside the boundaries of Waterloo County, especially by those who are interested in the development and progress of the Catholic Church in our Province in early times.

For in this History we obtain an authentic account of the trials, hardships and heroic lives of priests and people in those early days; we see them hewing log chapels and log buildings from the primeval forest; we behold them, as in a vitascope, going about intent, lovingly intent, on training their children in the morality, decency and religion they brought with them into the wilderness. In this book also we are everywhere face to face with personalities, genuine and real, with devout and self-sacrificing priests, and with men and women of heroic mould.

One of the difficulties when dealing with the sober circumstances of life in a newly-opened settlement is to choose between what is too interesting to omit in the record and what is too trifling to include. Father Spetz in this History manifests a remarkable sense for facts, a rare gift for verifying his statements so far as dates could be found, an ability to rate at their actual value the traditions of a community, and a quick discernment to detect the value of information when separating the legendary from the true.

The book is interesting and scholarly from cover to cover and is fall of reliable information from the pen of a writer, whose intimate familiarity with local documentary history and with many of the estimable characters introduced to the readers, deepens the fascination of its pages.

It is an admirable undertaking carried out in an admirable way and, independently of its intrinsic worth, its fine type, paper and binding, is a triumph of the art of photogravure illustration.
